## Trigger Intents

Use this skill when user prompts sound like:
- "What does this binary do?"
- "Find suspicious/security-relevant behavior."
- "Which libraries/frameworks are present?"
- "Give me a prioritized triage plan."
- "Show higher-level insights, not just raw rows."
- "Compare this decompilation to source."
- "Help make this function review-ready."

Route to adjacent skills when needed:
- Need raw caller/callee detail: `xrefs`
- Need assembly-level investigation: `disassembly`
- Need pseudocode semantics: `decompiler`
- Need editing/annotation: `annotations`

---

## Do This First (Warm-Start Sequence)

Start broad, then narrow:

```sql
-- 1) Binary orientation
SELECT * FROM binary;

-- 2) Capability hints from imports
SELECT module, name FROM imports ORDER BY module, name;

-- 3) Behavioral hints from strings
SELECT content, printf('0x%X', addr) AS addr
FROM strings
WHERE length >= 8
ORDER BY length DESC
LIMIT 40;
```

Interpretation guidance:
- Crypto/network/process APIs + suspicious strings usually indicate highest-value functions to inspect first.
- Move from "signals" to "functions" via `xrefs`/`disasm_calls`, then decompile likely hotspots.

---

## Failure and Recovery

- Empty/high-noise results:
  - Tighten patterns and pivot to module-specific imports.
  - Add JOINs with `funcs` and limit by size/name or call density.
- Missing decompiler surfaces:
  - Continue with `disassembly` + `xrefs` patterns.
- Timeout on complex analytics:
  - Decompose into staged CTEs and smaller candidate sets.

---

## Handoff Patterns

1. `analysis` -> `xrefs`: map signal addresses to caller/callee graph.
2. `analysis` -> `decompiler`: inspect semantic logic in highest-risk functions.
3. `analysis` -> `annotations`: persist findings as comments/renames and make the decompilation review-ready.

---

## High-Fidelity Review Handoff

When the user wants side-by-side comparison with source, or asks to "clean up" a function so it reads better, stop treating the task as read-only triage and hand off to `annotations`.

Use this review probe first:

```sql
SELECT decompile(0x401000);
SELECT idx, name, type FROM ctree_lvars WHERE func_addr = 0x401000 ORDER BY idx;
SELECT callee_name FROM disasm_calls WHERE func_addr = 0x401000;
```

Then route to `annotations` for the edit pass. Success markers for a review-ready function are:
- typed signature and clearer field access
- named locals, globals, and labels
- one heading-style summary comment near function start
- folder placement when the function belongs to a durable triage/review bucket
- less raw pointer math and fewer generic temp names

Treat that summary comment as part of the analysis product, not just presentation polish:
- it should support semantic search later
- it should help whole-program understanding when many functions have already been annotated

Non-goal:
- exact source syntax. Decompiler-stable forms such as `qmemcpy(...)` can still be acceptable if names, types, and comments are correct.

## Quick Start Examples

### "What does this binary do?"

```sql
-- Entry points
SELECT * FROM entries;

-- Imported APIs (hints at functionality)
SELECT module, name FROM imports ORDER BY module, name;

-- Interesting strings
SELECT content FROM strings WHERE length > 10 ORDER BY length DESC LIMIT 20;
```

### "Find security-relevant code"

```sql
-- Dangerous string functions
SELECT DISTINCT (SELECT name FROM funcs WHERE func_addr >= addr AND func_addr < end_addr LIMIT 1) FROM disasm_calls
WHERE callee_name IN ('strcpy', 'strcat', 'sprintf', 'gets');

-- Crypto-related
SELECT * FROM imports WHERE name LIKE '%Crypt%' OR name LIKE '%Hash%';

-- Network-related
SELECT * FROM imports WHERE name LIKE '%socket%' OR name LIKE '%connect%' OR name LIKE '%send%';

-- File likely network triage candidates under a durable folder
INSERT INTO dirtree_folders(tree, path) VALUES ('funcs', 'idasql/triage/network');
UPDATE funcs
SET folder_path = 'idasql/triage/network'
WHERE addr IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT func_addr FROM disasm_calls
  WHERE callee_name LIKE '%socket%' OR callee_name LIKE '%connect%' OR callee_name LIKE '%send%'
);
```

### "Understand a specific function"

```sql
-- Basic info
SELECT * FROM funcs WHERE addr = 0x401000;

-- Full disassembly
SELECT disasm_func(0x401000);

-- Decompile (if Hex-Rays available)
SELECT decompile(0x401000);

-- Local variables
SELECT name, type, size FROM ctree_lvars WHERE func_addr = 0x401000;

-- What it calls
SELECT callee_name FROM disasm_calls WHERE func_addr = 0x401000;

-- What calls it
SELECT (SELECT name FROM funcs WHERE from_addr >= addr AND from_addr < end_addr LIMIT 1) FROM xrefs WHERE to_addr = 0x401000 AND is_code = 1;
```

### "Find all uses of a string"

```sql
SELECT s.content, (SELECT name FROM funcs WHERE x.from_addr >= addr AND x.from_addr < end_addr LIMIT 1) as function, printf('0x%X', x.from_addr) as location
FROM strings s
JOIN xrefs x ON s.addr = x.to_addr
WHERE s.content LIKE '%config%';
```

## Natural Language Query Examples

### Function Signature Queries

**"Show me functions that return integers"**
```sql
SELECT name, return_type, arg_count FROM funcs
WHERE return_is_integral = 1 LIMIT 20;

-- Or via types_func_args (typedef-aware)
SELECT DISTINCT type_name FROM types_func_args
WHERE arg_index = -1 AND is_integral_resolved = 1;
```

**"Show me functions that take 4 string arguments"**
```sql
SELECT type_name, COUNT(*) as string_args
FROM types_func_args
WHERE arg_index >= 0
  AND is_ptr_resolved = 1
  AND base_type_resolved IN ('char', 'wchar_t', 'CHAR', 'WCHAR')
GROUP BY type_ordinal
HAVING string_args = 4;
```

**"Which functions return pointers?"**
```sql
SELECT name, return_type FROM funcs
WHERE return_is_ptr = 1 ORDER BY name LIMIT 20;
```

**"Find void functions with many arguments"**
```sql
SELECT name, arg_count FROM funcs
WHERE return_is_void = 1 AND arg_count >= 4
ORDER BY arg_count DESC;
```

**"What calling conventions are used?"**
```sql
SELECT calling_conv, COUNT(*) as count FROM funcs
WHERE calling_conv IS NOT NULL AND calling_conv != ''
GROUP BY calling_conv ORDER BY count DESC;
```

### Return Value Analysis

> **Scale notice:** `ctree_v_returns` inherits decompiler behavior — joined against
> all of `funcs` it decompiles **every function** (fine on small binaries, hours on
> a 452k-function database). On a big database, seed the join with a bounded
> function set (working set from anchors, or `funcs ORDER BY size DESC LIMIT N`)
> and add `LIMIT`. Same rule for every `ctree_v_*` view.

**"Which functions return 0?"** — small databases:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT f.name FROM funcs f
JOIN ctree_v_returns r ON r.func_addr = f.addr
WHERE r.return_num = 0 LIMIT 50;
```

**"Which functions return 0?"** — big databases (bounded seed):
```sql
WITH seed AS (SELECT addr, name FROM funcs ORDER BY size DESC LIMIT 200)
SELECT DISTINCT s.name FROM seed s
JOIN ctree_v_returns r ON r.func_addr = s.addr
WHERE r.return_num = 0 LIMIT 50;
```

**"Find functions that return -1 (error pattern)"**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT f.name FROM funcs f
JOIN ctree_v_returns r ON r.func_addr = f.addr
WHERE r.return_num = -1 LIMIT 50;
```

**"Functions that return their input argument"**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT f.name FROM funcs f
JOIN ctree_v_returns r ON r.func_addr = f.addr
WHERE r.returns_arg = 1 LIMIT 50;
```

**"Functions that return the result of another call (wrappers)"**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT f.name FROM funcs f
JOIN ctree_v_returns r ON r.func_addr = f.addr
WHERE r.returns_call_result = 1 LIMIT 50;
```

**"Functions with multiple return statements"**
```sql
SELECT f.name, COUNT(*) as return_count
FROM funcs f
JOIN ctree_v_returns r ON r.func_addr = f.addr
GROUP BY f.addr
HAVING return_count > 1
ORDER BY return_count DESC LIMIT 20;
```

## Common Query Patterns

> **Scale notice:** several patterns below are *whole-program* aggregates —
> `xrefs`/`disasm_calls`/`blocks`/`ctree_v_*` grouped over all functions. They are
> the right tool on small binaries and toxic on big ones (full scans; the
> `ctree_v_*` ones decompile every function). On a big database, apply the same
> bounded-seed pattern shown in Return Value Analysis, or work from a working set
> (`bigdb`). Every example here carries a `LIMIT` — keep it that way.

### Find Most Called Functions

```sql
SELECT f.name, COUNT(*) as callers
FROM funcs f
JOIN xrefs x ON f.addr = x.to_addr
WHERE x.is_code = 1
GROUP BY f.addr
ORDER BY callers DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Find Functions Calling a Specific API

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT (SELECT name FROM funcs WHERE from_addr >= addr AND from_addr < end_addr LIMIT 1) as caller
FROM xrefs
WHERE to_addr = (SELECT addr FROM imports WHERE name = 'CreateFileW');
```

### String Cross-Reference Analysis

```sql
SELECT s.content, (SELECT name FROM funcs WHERE x.from_addr >= addr AND x.from_addr < end_addr LIMIT 1) as used_by
FROM strings s
JOIN xrefs x ON s.addr = x.to_addr
WHERE s.content LIKE '%password%';
```

### Function Complexity (by Block Count)

```sql
SELECT (SELECT name FROM funcs WHERE func_addr >= addr AND func_addr < end_addr LIMIT 1) as name, COUNT(*) as block_count
FROM blocks
GROUP BY func_addr
ORDER BY block_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Find Leaf Functions (No Outgoing Calls)

```sql
SELECT f.name, f.size
FROM funcs f
LEFT JOIN disasm_calls c ON c.func_addr = f.addr
GROUP BY f.addr
HAVING COUNT(c.addr) = 0
ORDER BY f.size DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Functions with Deep Call Chains

```sql
SELECT f.name, MAX(cc.depth) as max_depth
FROM disasm_v_call_chains cc
JOIN funcs f ON f.addr = cc.root_func
GROUP BY cc.root_func
ORDER BY max_depth DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

For targeted traversal, prefer the `call_graph` table over `disasm_v_call_chains`:

```sql
-- Map all functions in a call subtree (bounded; depth ≤3 while exploring in
-- dense graphs — see bigdb)
SELECT func_name, depth FROM call_graph
WHERE start = 0x401000 AND direction = 'down' AND max_depth = 5
LIMIT 100;
```

### Trace Call Path to Target Function

```sql
-- Trace call path to an internal helper (max_depth is a search bound; output
-- is at most the path length)
SELECT step, func_name FROM shortest_path
WHERE from_addr = (SELECT addr FROM funcs WHERE name = 'main')
  AND to_addr = (SELECT addr FROM funcs WHERE name = 'copy_user_input')
  AND max_depth = 20;
```

Use `call_graph` + `disasm_calls` + `imports` when the destination is an imported
API. `shortest_path` endpoints must resolve to functions.

### Find All Strings Reachable from a Function

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT sr.string_value
FROM call_graph cg
JOIN string_refs sr ON sr.func_addr = cg.func_addr
WHERE cg.start = 0x401000 AND cg.direction = 'down' AND cg.max_depth = 3;
```

### Three-Way: Strings + Imports Reachable from a Function

```sql
-- Three-way: strings + imports reachable from a function
SELECT 'string' as kind, sr.string_value as detail, cg.func_name as via_func
FROM call_graph cg
JOIN string_refs sr ON sr.func_addr = cg.func_addr
WHERE cg.start = 0x401000 AND cg.direction = 'down' AND cg.max_depth = 5
  AND sr.string_value LIKE '%http%'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'import', i.name, cg.func_name
FROM call_graph cg
JOIN disasm_calls dc ON dc.func_addr = cg.func_addr
JOIN imports i ON dc.callee_addr = i.addr
WHERE cg.start = 0x401000 AND cg.direction = 'down' AND cg.max_depth = 5
ORDER BY kind, detail;
```
